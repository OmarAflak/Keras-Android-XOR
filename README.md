# How to use a Tensorflow model on Android

This code is a super simple example to understand how to run a Tensorflow (or Keras) model on Android.

## Train the model on a computer

run the python script :

    python index.py
    
When done, the script should have created an `out` folder which contains several files. Among them, **`tensorflow_lite_xor_nn.pb`**, which is the model to export in Android **assets** folder.
